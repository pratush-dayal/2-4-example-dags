### Workaround to 'zip' arguments in Airflow 2.3.

This DAG shows an example implementation of comparing data between two
S3 buckets and a table in Snowflake by using a Python decorated task to zip
the information together (a 2.3 workaround for the new 2.4 feature).

The DAG gathers the names of all .txt files in S3_BUCKET_1 and S3_BUCKET_2, as
well as information from a DATE and a CUSTOMER column in Snowflake. The
information from XCom is zipped using the zip_longest function from the
itertools package in a Python decorated task. A comparing function checks that
the date in the name of the files from S3_BUCKET_1 and the customer in the name
of the files from S3_BUCKET_2 match up chronologically with the information in
the Snowflake table.
Any mismatch will cause a failure of the DAG.

This DAG needs both, a Snowflake and Amazon S3 connection. The format of the
.txt file names is: YYYY_MM_DD_CUSTOMERNAME.txt.
